                                There are many aspects in assessing a company&apos;s technology capabilities which would depend on the companyâ€™s current technology stack. Generally companies would assess their technology capabilities in terms of data, infrastructure, security, integration, etc. However, on a high-level, the process of as-is state analysis is as follows:

                                </p>
                                <li className="mt-8 flex gap-x-3"><CheckCircleIcon className="mt-1 h-5 w-5 flex-none text-indigo-600" aria-hidden="true" />
                                    <span><strong>Collect data </strong>  by preparing an application portfolio or a standardized document for application owners and users to fill out. The column would signify the aspect on which the company would want to collect data. For example, column headers could include application name, application criticality, tools and technology used for the application, pain points and bottlenecks, regulatory compliance, etc.
